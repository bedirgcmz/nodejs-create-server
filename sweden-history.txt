History of Sweden
Ice Age, Iron Age, IT Age. This is your quick guide to the history of Sweden.
We'll start this journey through the history of Sweden in the period of 8,000 BC to 6,000 BC. This is when Sweden as a whole became populated by people who lived by hunting, gathering and fishing, and who used simple stone tools. Dwelling places and graves dating from the Stone Age, lasting until about 1,800 BC, are found today in increasing numbers.

The Bronze Age was marked in the Nordic region – especially in Denmark, but also in Sweden – by a high level of culture, shown by the artifacts found in graves.

After 500 BC, such artifacts become increasingly rare as iron came into more general use. During the early Iron Age, the population of Sweden became settled, and agriculture came to form the basis of the economy and society.
